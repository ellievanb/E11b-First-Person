# E11b-First-Person

This is my first opportunity to begin to experiment with a first-person perspective in a Godot 3D environment. This exercise involves creating collision shapes to represent the player's body and then controlling the camera with the keyboard and mouse.

In the finsihed version, the camera is in the place of the character so as the character moves (using WASD and the space bar to jump)< so does the camera. There's also a gun in what would be the character's right hand so that (I'm assuming) in the future we can add something to make the gun shoot bullets.
